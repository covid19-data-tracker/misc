# To do

* build a thing that pulls down the data from https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data in Spring Batch 
* build a cloud foundry task that can run the analytics on this data 
* build a AWS Lambda function that launches the CF task [whenever there's a github webhook](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/hooks/#create-a-hook) indicating that the repository has been updated
* build a static site that has a google maps app displaying the updated data
